dhcp\nPlease fire an issue if you don't find answers here or check the change log\n1. Why I can't ping WAN after installing routing\nIt is probably because of an incorrect WAN configuration. Please follow the steps to check \n\nExecute make test_state to test current state, it should be RUNNING and all test cases should be passed (you can see a green True in the front of each statement). \n\nThen execute make showconf to check your configuration. Make sure LAN and WAN you filled are correct comparing with the result from ip link.\n\n\n2. Why I can't ping public IP after install routing\nIt is probably because of an incorrect iptables rules added. Please follow the steps to check \n\nRun make test_state to test current state, it should be RUNNING and all test cases should be passed (you can see a green True in the front of each statement). \n\nThen check rules in iptables, make sure LAN and WAN are correct, e.g, if enp2s0 is WAN and br0 is LAN, then it should look like this:\n-P POSTROUTING ACCEPT\n-A POSTROUTING -o enp2s0 -j MASQUERADE \n-P FORWARD ACCEPT\n-A FORWARD -i enp2s0 -o br0 -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT\n-A FORWARD -i enp2s0 -o br0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n-A FORWARD -i br0 -o enp2s0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\n\n"},"faq/TSPPPOE.html":{"url":"faq/TSPPPOE.html","title":"Trouble shooting for PPPoE","keywords":"","body":"Trouble shooting for PPPoE\nPlease fire an issue if you don't find answers here or check the change log\n1.
